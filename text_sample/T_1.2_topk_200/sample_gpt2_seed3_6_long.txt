Jai Yang's role is extremely mysterious. The incident must have happened during his run through Tianjing Hall, he plans to complete that. However, unfortunately for him already, the possibility of it being too late can feel like too much fun to fulfill that evil ambitions. After that was clear the most, Ye Tamer took matters into his own hands, preparing himself for finally entering Jangu Old School as one of the first students to enter the hall. Suddenly, she told Jiang Mi about the realisation and power of she-Devastated Chu for his heart's sake too. Another day the very first year for 2012 they both went to Tsinghua Hall, and just outside there Yang Jiang heard the news and moved in.

A group of him like that headed up the crowded stage.

Every day the usual days in the previous year opened, their teachers were just about to say where had taken the form of a teacher and how many class photos and they could form them by hand, why didn't Zhang Yuan Wu have any of them? How could I manage the training long after this? How much further was the day to the day through, every summer year since ancient Yangmang was beginning there meant no trip back to Yangmán?

Zhang Qiang felt his skin shivering as he took a breath, already feeling his soul trembling to the core, he reached that kind of moment again and was actually not able to resist stopping, Jai Yang did the exact same thing on Yubikeya stage too, he wasn't an instant out of "this is too new," or has something a little younger in Yangmang have left. Everyone was on their way back together long ago too, out at Eversound, or somewhere.

As if to ensure they only gained a first minute pace upon entering the hall there was many loud shoutings at Huo Yu but there wasn't any. 'Go to the living room, don't look any further while hoeing from him!' no one listened as they started to pelt his hand on the table quietly.

Huo Yu grabbed the grubby arm and put it down. Feeling more comfortable only now did he imagine that it wasn't nothing, he didn't recognize after all who Ye Tamer's aunt Rumin was! Besides Liao Guo of Golden Star who is an elderly lady was lying there as she sat in Yue Yun's recliner having eaten that of what had been put into Yubikeya party; the most shocking sight that person was experienced's getting up right when after all of your injuries had diminished countless stars in their bones all along… the idea no one came from what that could've been.

Their body shook very soon. Jin Chou, the future Hua Young has already reached his age and perhaps Yubicha to be his apprentice, to change, of what he feels. The only one who would have moved aside more than right away: The little sister.

Eggs with green fruits along this path soon came into their cupboards, the little girls were smiling as they looked over the little man. Looks like they heard Ye Tamer snicker when they looked at each other. Looking up at Jian Chen Yun, Yun was delighted for after this moment; he never thought of the great treasure chest that Ah Xiong Hall had after long enough. The five members of Yangmang must be over ten thousand years old again, why are they not any older though after all Yangmang had much experience chasing after this fellow far back too? Are all of these seven year old sisters to be the only ones who have even realised that Hao Xue was really able to do what at the state have always done but to create such remarkable wealth with just short time overlong? That Hao Xue should go so far before Ye Tamer?

Bin Xie passed Chu Young's body along tightly in a huge hug, only him and Elder Ye did not.

Cousin couldn't express her anger at Ling Sedi like that before but for herself! This person was a genius! Zhen Shi had never met a pupil truly daring to die on the front line, even younger as soon as she saw Ye Tamer in this staunching sight! This disciple was Hao Xue Meng!

Wang Baohuo snorted and laughed in pain to the huffing and bubbling sounds in the world, there needs to be something done. On Yi Wang in Huiming this youth had said first of all by way of comments that it felt as though Yangma should release him like Dang Dong must have done as she left this house – "Lu is going to send to Liu Hong here all on their own! Just before leaving this place she's going to send more guards so if your body isn't able to perform at all, people from near her will come to place there instead of fighting before your body." Zhinchu Han's young brother Jiang Ti here had all of his face
