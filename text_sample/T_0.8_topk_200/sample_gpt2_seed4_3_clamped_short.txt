Bernie Sanders, because its position on the substance of the debate itself is the most important thing among the four main contenders in the race to be the Democratic nominee for president and vice president in 2016.

Sanders has said many times that the Democratic party has become divided since the 2012 primary, when he criticized the Clinton administration for not releasing sufficient video evidence of the crimes of Hillary Clinton's campaign earlier that year.

Sanders has said he thinks the vast majority of Americans "don't care about the criminal justice system," and that these statements are "unprovable."

Despite his statements, the debate has become increasingly about Sanders, who has been lambasted and criticized throughout the campaign and in public, and who is focusing on the fact that party leaders are not following in the right footsteps.

Clinton has often criticized Sanders for his attacks on the Democratic Party, saying both he and his campaign were wrong about several aspects of Sanders's message and said he has "lost touch" with the progressive ideals he believes in.

The debate has also been widely called out by progressive organizations (such as MoveOn.Org) and other press organizations for being "defining" a debate, and it has led to a host of controversies. The debates have also created an over-the-top situation where a certain amount of debate and discussion, even if it is not a proper debate, can lead to a misunderstanding of the discussion in the eyes of the public.

The debate has also led to the release of several long-discussed videos, which have been a focal point of social media for the liberal wing of the Democratic party for years.

In one of the videos, released on July 9, 2012, Clinton uses an open microphone to make a speech that she then usefully responds with a line she has made repeatedly in the past.

The Sanders campaign has been quick to file a lawsuit against the Democratic Party for its failure to consider these videos and its response to them.

The Sanders campaign has also been criticized for being unable to address the many issues the Sanders campaign has brought up as part of its efforts to elect Clinton, such as the ongoing investigation into the use of campaign financial records by the Democratic National Committee and the release of the transcripts of Clinton's private emails.<|endoftext|>(CNN) -- The world's most famous military judge who was one of seven men who found guilty of a terrorist attack on a U.S. service member's family in Afghanistan said Monday that he believes he has been punished for his war crimes.

In his final statement before the jury in the case, U.S. Army Gen. Joseph Dunford said the verdict, which is now up for a second trial, was an "extraordinary step" on the part of Bush administration officials who had failed to follow or follow up on a series of convictions in the case.

"It was extraordinary to me that the Army Judge, Judge Dunford, after going to the United States Senate, gave a final verdict that was so stunning, one that I thought the Justice Department should follow up on," Dunford said in his statement to CNN.

The military judge's trial began a day after the attack in Kandahar, Afghanistan, killing three American service members.

The only civilian of the two-person unit killed was Sergeant Brian Terry, who was working his way through a training camp in Afghanistan when he was attacked. After being shot by a sniper while he was preparing to leave the compound, Terry ran to help his girlfriend.

He was shot and killed, in a shootout that lasted nearly 20 seconds, Dunford said.

"Defendant Dunford took responsibility for his actions, and the judge should have been as harsh as ever," Dunford said.

A congressional investigation found that Dunford had ordered a review of the military's legal system to help him in his defense.

Dunford said on Monday that he believes the military believes the accused should not have been sentenced or given a pardon.

The judge's comments came as Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that he held a news conference to discuss the trial of the three U.S. service members.

Dunford did not address the jury or the decision to acquit the military.

Dunford was convicted in 1992 of bringing an explosive device to an auto parts store in San Diego. Detainees in that case said they had been
