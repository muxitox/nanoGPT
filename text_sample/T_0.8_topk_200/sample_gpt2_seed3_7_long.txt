The woman's face moved from her hands to her head, but she kept the distance. She was only waiting for the doctor's pain to subside.

"No. No. No. See that boy again. He's already dead."

Greetings,

Our Captain. It was expected.

We had heard of a number of possible survivors, and we would have some of them back.

However, once the patient managed to flee the hospital, they had already been transferred to one of the hospitals in the south to receive treatment for their injuries.

Greetings,

Greetings,

Captain.

I hope you and I can finish tracking this down quickly, so we can get this right, in case you ever find yourself in a hospital with a doctor who knows things enough to diagnose you.

After all, the worst case scenario, if you do find yourself in a hospital where the patient has no clue, is that the doctor is a professional with real medical expertise.

So, I'm not even going to get into what it would cost to know who, or at least not which, of these people would need to be on the run from us.

Darling, there are plenty of things that are not possible under the circumstances, but you and I, as well as all of us in the medical profession, are working diligently to make sure we get this right.

I mean, if we had to make a choice, I would be only too willing to take risk.

But if our team of surgeons lost three people to a gunshot, then why was there no one to die?

If it weren't for the presence of an emergency physician, we would be in no better position to deal with this situation.

As it is, we are currently dealing with a large number of emergency personnel who are not taking any action, and are looking for a possible other way to bring the situation under control.

Greetings,

Captain.

I will have to return to the patient.

When that time comes, we can move on to the next patient.

Thank you very much,

Greetings,

Captain.

We have been with you in this hospital a long time just like this, and we are always able to make sure that we are doing everything possible to make sure that no one is ever left behind.

After all, there are many, many people who could be in our care right now.

Once we gather the information and take that home with us, we must also make sure to keep our options open.

And if we get that right, we would have no choice but to focus on what we are able to prevent or prevent deaths.

Captain, we do not know who is going to die, but we know that they are people who have no other choice.

We will need to go over the case to see if that may help us bring the situation under control.

Now, I have to make sure that the problem does not pass in any way that might cause major problems for our team of surgeons.

And if we do not immediately destroy the area that is the most important for us, we will not be able to bring the situation under control.

But, there is one serious problem that is clear.

We cannot afford to have our surgeons return to the hospital.

We need to get them there immediately.

But we will need to find the way forward.

I might as well say that we have been working to ensure that everyone is safe this time around.

Darling, I have said this before, and it's true.

We have been working hard to ensure that everyone is safe this time around.

Captain, we have been working hard to ensure that every one of you and I can finally find a cure for this disease.

Now, I know that I am not the only one who is likely to face this problem, but I must say that this is a lifeblood of medical practice.

The patient that you have just shot, whose body has been lost too quickly, is no longer someone who will be able to pass this disease back around.

The conditions that you are going to face here are very real, and I believe that our team of surgeons are set to make an extraordinary sacrifice.

But we are not going to waste any more time. We have to do everything we can to ensure that we do everything we can to bring the situation under control, and out of the hospital.

Now, I was just about to say that I must tell you, but I can assure you that this is not going to happen.

My doctor has to work with us right now, and we need to work together to bring the situation under control.

By the way, if you are going to be with us
