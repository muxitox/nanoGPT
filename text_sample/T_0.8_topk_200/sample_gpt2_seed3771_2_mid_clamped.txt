When the president discussed the move, he said on Saturday that "to me, it's about time that we stop. It's been three years since I've been in the White House."

Trump told Fox News on Sunday that the move, made under the leadership of former President Barack Obama, is a "very, very bad thing" that would end the country.

"Gaining some of these workers is going to be big for everybody who's working but also for the country that's supporting them, it's going to be a great deal for everybody who's doing their jobs. It's going to be a great deal for our country," Trump said.

"We've seen some really bad things happen in the past, but with my administration, you know what? What we have left is what we've learned from my administration. And I think that we can continue to build a better relationship with our allies, with our friends around the world, and with China. And I think that can be had with the people of the United States of America," he said.

Trump ended his remarks at the end of the day with a hug from First Lady Melania Trump.

"And these are the things that you have to know before Trump acts. And I want you to know these things before he acts," Trump told reporters.

As with previous announcements, Trump was not in the Oval Office this morning and did not make an appearance at a rally or attend a press conference. He will meet with his staff before leaving the White House on Monday.
