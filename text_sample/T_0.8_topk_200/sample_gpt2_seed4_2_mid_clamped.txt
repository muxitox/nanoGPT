Hiroshima, the Japanese equivalent of the American Empire, was founded in 1910. If you hadn't heard of him, you probably didn't know that he is considered one of Japan's most iconic heroes. His military prowess can be seen in his battle against monsters in the middle of the field, and his ability to go down to earth and break people's hearts. He never allowed himself to be a target for the monster hordes, and this is why after leaving the military he decided to become a superhero. Even though he was brought up in the military, he doesn't want to face them. "I think he is a little too cool to be a hero," he said.

In the manga, he also comes from a family of superheroes. His parents, Satoru & Kiko are the heroes of the manga, and their parents are super-heroes. They are also one of the most versatile characters in the manga. He's known as an ace of the air, and he does his best to protect his parents.

What make you think that Hiroshima was a real hero?

The film, no trailer, and then their movie are all pretty similar. I thought that his popularity and his fame would be great if not for the trailer and the film, but his popularity seems to be getting less so. During the movie he gives the stage to Sh≈çwa-sensei and Hayami-sensei. In the manga he also tries to fight the monsters in the basement of an elementary school.

So who is your favorite hero of all time?
