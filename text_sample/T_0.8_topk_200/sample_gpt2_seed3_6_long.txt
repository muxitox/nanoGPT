Jai Yang's eyes were extremely puffy and he must have been lying there in pain. In this little room, there was a little door, and he knew that there was something here it was too late to block the way.

Jai Yang ran to the window and looked at the very small window, but it was closed.

Yang immediately took a step forward and threw open the door. He looked around the room, but what he saw were no tents, no cabs, and no tables. By the time he entered, his clothes were off too.

His clothes were still in the bed, and he was surrounded by more than a dozen people. Yang did not bother to show him that.

"Who are you?" Yang asked.

"I am Jai Yang." Jai Yang's heart skipped a beat.

Jai Yang did not know what he was talking about, but he was afraid it would be too hard for him to talk to anyone all day.

The large cabin was about 20 meters long. The only person who could see it from the side was Yang Chen. He was very pale and somewhat sick, but he was already there.

"What are you doing here?" Yang asked.

"I'm a mage." Jai Yang was incredibly shocked.

Yang Chen was obviously a mage, and he simply couldn't understand why he would be so shocked.

"There isn't any room in the inn, can you tell me what you're doing here?" Yang asked.

"What are you doing here?" Jai Yang's eyes filled with surprise.

"Ah, there is no room in the inn, can you tell me what you're doing here?" Yang asked with a deep breath.

"There is a large inn, and it's at the entrance. It's not a place to rest, just the living room, the restroom, and the dishes. When you come here, you'll be able to talk to me for some reason, like a normal person. Since this is your body, you won't be sleeping, but you will be able to do some very important things." Yang said.

"You're going to be sleeping?"

"If I don't listen to you, then I won't be able to come here. I'll have to leave in 3 minutes."

"You don't know what to do with that? This is a dungeon, and you're going to need to find a way to escape. But if you can't, then you can stay here for 3 weeks. It's best for you to come for 2 days. But you need to find some way to escape from here." Yang said.

"But we can't go there, because it's not safe. It's not like you can say, 'I only see you in the mirror.'" Yang said.

"You do not think it's safe for me to go there?"

"I can't go, because it's not safe." Jai Yang's answer was very clear.

"How can you go there?" Yang asked.

"Well, we can easily go to the inn. It seems that it is already crowded at the inn, since there's not much room. In the long run, we can save some money, and you can stay in this inn. If you don't take care of yourself, then you can stay here for much longer." Yang said.

"The inn is in the middle of the mountain, so you can't go there. But that's fine with you, right?" Yang said.

"Of course. But you can't go there just for that. You can go there if you want, or you can stay here for a while. Now, you need to find something to carry you in. Some things will be important to you, so you won't need to return to the inn for a while. What you need to do is to go and meet with someone to play something with, so that the two of you will have an easy time getting along." Yang said.

"You saw that, even though I'm not who I thought I was. That person he mentioned is a student who's from Baohui, but he was in a different place from me. I feel like I should have been able to tell him why he's here. He may know, but I'm still too young. He didn't want to go through so many things going on. I won't listen to you, and I won't listen to any type of talk. I'll just go to the courtyard here."

"What are you going to do?" Yang asked.

"I will go from here right away. I'll keep going to the courtyard, and come back 10 minutes later if I have anything to say." Yang said.

"You can't save all of your money
