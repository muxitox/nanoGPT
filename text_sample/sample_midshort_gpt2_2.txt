The party accused the opposition of being traitors because they claim that Mr. Obama, like Mr. Bush before him, has been unable to secure funding for basic needs like breast cancer research.

"Mr. Romney doesn't want to spend millions of dollars while at the State Department," Representative Robert Bork said.

Voters in Utah also had lower average incomes and weaker consumer confidence after Mr. Obama won. Roughly 40% of voters nationwide remain "very pessimistic," according to a new Rasmussen poll from November.

The Obama campaign had hoped that voters would turn out to elect a president they believe in, but polling was conducted in a vacuum and the electorate wasn't responding to that.
