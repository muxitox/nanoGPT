And, in his own effort to convince himself that he was right, he made a donation to a charity in Kenya called Yanele School of Design.

The Kenyan government's aid program to schools and its supposed lack of any accountability makes him believe he's being generous. But then, in fact, he's more concerned about his own life and his own future than about his charity.

And that, in turn, probably sets him apart from many of the small number of people who donate their time to causes that are supposed to be seen as charity.

To be fair, the general public, too, might be very concerned about what they pay for, especially when it comes to the cost of food, shelter and other things.

But in all honesty, it's hard to understand how a society can afford to have so many people, at such high incomes, feel so many things during the day and by the time they are doing so, they've been through so much.

Many of the same people who keep cropping up in the headlines are actually very healthy.

There's that fear associated with having too many people living in poverty, if we're going to have any hope of developing a better world.

But, if we want to make a better world, we need to stop talking about what happens in poverty.

We need to start talking about what happens in poverty.

You can see why Cameron is so desperate to get his voice heard in this particular debate. He's not just the leader of the Labour party. His party is the party. It's a coalition government, but it could be a coalition government with all the centre-right parties the public trusts.

There's a lot of resentment at the way the Labour Party is treating poverty. And that's what Cameron and other big Tories really are trying to do.

Well, if you get a big chunk of the electorate in, say, Bradford or Harrow or east London, you have to be very careful about who you talk to.

Cameron and Labour's support in Labour's favour in this election is a very, very small share. The majority of the voters who went to the polls in 2010 and 2011 will not have voted for Bill English for the first time.

And who knows, maybe the Lib Dems might be able to deliver the same thing.

In any case, he's made another mistake.

He should have admitted that he was wrong.

He should have been accused of lying when he said that he would start a public inquiry into the causes of poverty.

He should have asked the charity WorkforIt.org or the Oxfam group to look into it.

He should have started a real investigation into the charities he runs.

He should have been accused of having a hand in the so-called 'London to Birmingham' scheme, which has cost over Â£100m to run for over two decades.

He should have become much more focussed on the causes of poverty in his own country and set out his vision for how we would achieve that.

He should have been asked to resign.

And yet this is the man who has gone into almost all of the same public service that he has.

That's not who he is.

It's all the same, as he told his interviewer.

"We need to have a public inquiry into the causes of poverty," Cameron told interviewer Piers Morgan.

He should have been asked that very question.

A public inquiry could have exonerated him, given the sheer volume of people who have donated their time and money to charities.

The truth is that he's not the only one who has told the truth, and that's right.

He's the only one who has been able to bring the full weight of responsibility to bear on the individual who's making such an effort.

And he's the one who should have been given an opportunity to ask him about it.

When you're one of our great achievements, we expect to be held accountable for it.

We just need to remind the public what's at stake.

We need to give our best for our country, our children and our future.

We just need to be open to it.

We need to do our best to ensure that we do this.

And that's something we're going to continue to do.

This is not a contest that Britain should play for the sake of our prosperity.

It's not a contest that we should have to let go of on the basis of the problems that we live with.

It's not a contest that we should be unwilling, in the words of the Parliamentary Labour Party, to stand in the way of greater progress for our citizens
