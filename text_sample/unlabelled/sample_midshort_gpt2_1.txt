The group said the incident did not meet their definition of abusive behaviour, as well as allowing some students to "inappropriate contact with persons seen by them only to allow such activities to continue."

"We wish that there was some further information and guidance, but due to privacy considerations, we will be unable to provide immediate updates at this time," students said in the release

"However, it is certainly possible that the person might become involved in some other inappropriate activities as well as also being known to us or made aware of the incidents. We would urge its privacy only, not to contact the student or conduct any specific offence such as any other inappropriate behaviour."

Gardas also said they have only found evidence from both "a small number of students who have been at the students' home in Gloucestershire for 15 years or more who have sent or received indecent images of students over the past 12 weeks," which identified 11 student accused of abusing an A student.

A statement from the student's home council said there had been no reported incidents and no outstanding charges had been brought, with the principal revealing a CCTV investigation was continuing.
