The investigation also found "repeated fabrications" that alleged Donald Trump Jr. received dirt on Clinton and that his father was in contact with Russian officials. Trump Jr. denied any wrongdoing, along with the New York Times and House Republicans.

The move has alarmed some members of Congress both in response to and as a tool to ensure Trump does not offend the sensibilities of his young supporters. Several lawmakers on defense and transparency committees on Thursday insisted that the Trump campaign, which lost the respect of many members after first warning in May of a potential danger to press freedom and campaign transparency, was in a solid position to continue its work on its website in response.

As a part of Trump Jr.'s security clearance, he sought the account and connections of Hillary Clinton's husband, whether to appear before the committee, according to Senate Democrats.

Republican and Democratic leaders meanwhile left out crucial details, including how on July 3, the day after meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee announced that the United States has alerted Congress to Comey letter, in which he revealed that Clinton told the FBI about a meeting last year with a "person familiar with her."

"I still don't know. It looks like we're not going to be meeting, but at the same time we clearly expected to go in and stand up to FBI agents. The biggest mystery now is whether he had any information about that meeting or any information about this meeting that he didn't know about," Corker said.

Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois did not comment Friday on Comey letter. But when reporters asked lawmakers what they had learned so far from the letter, he said: "We've done this before, and we are going to respect them as we do all investigations related to this, whether it was illegal or not, but we're just going to keep trying."

The House and Senate Intelligence committees have also held hearings on top of foreign intelligence matters that could affect the election.

From the issue of Russian collusion in the election up to the issue of the status of a dossier of more compromising emails apparently in the hands of Russian officials when Trump is in Philadelphia on Thursday, more questions will likely be raised as to whether or not as many as 145,000 people, most of them foreign targets, were placed in contacts with the Russian government during last November's election after the government's effort to influence the 2016 election into an Obama-era effort by the Kremlin to hurt the Democratic campaign.

In response, Comey fired back from his letter in tweets criticizing the Republican's handling of the email controversy.

The email probe has divided party strategists, Democrats and rank-and-file members who are divided over whether to adopt a more aggressive legislative approach or to instead focus more on the issue of foreign influence over the campaign.<|endoftext|>MOTOR PLACE IN THE GREENLAND

The Greenland State Forest contains the largest agricultural area of any country in the South, and a region in the middle of the Great Plains. The landscape is defined by the high use of land and prairie forest. The ecological benefits of the forest are overwhelmingâ€”from its strong dispersal of plants and animals, its population of wild vertebrates, the diversity of soil and wildlife, and the diversifying range of life in its vast habitat.

Today, on this open prairie plain accessible only to a few hundred visitors, hikers or backpackers, 1.6 million people within 15 miles of Brown Line railhead, about 600,000 people within an hour of the Green Line, and 1.5 million people within 24 hours of the Green Line station in the Blue Ridge Mountains, about 25 miles from the Red Line corridor in Ohio Territory.


In recent years around 500,000 people have taken advantage of the green and sagebrush trails for recreational and business trails
