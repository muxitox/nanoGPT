Stonewall: I think it will happen. Again, I was listening yesterday to Radio 2 you are talking about the BCT. They had a very small target on the BCT, and that target didn't lie at the Vauxhall factory they need to close because of safety problems and the poor local workers who have had the pleasure of seeing us work for this company for so long. I give Mr. Thatcher that day, that he feels sorry for the whole country when he speaks of this problem, but his concern for the future is not international.
