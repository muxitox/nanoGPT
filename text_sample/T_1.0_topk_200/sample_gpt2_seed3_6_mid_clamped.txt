Jai Yang's role is extremely strong. The first four of them are pretty good too. In this series he is not the most effective commander but he is strong enough to seriously threaten the field and have major impact on the matchup.

Jai Yang RNG: No surprise. We have very high variance in the 3-3 formation and even in the 3/4 formations. The Y-Wing or Y-Wing Fighter can usually counter what is his plan unless he gets close to the wall and tries to block his options. If only for his card turn and his first opponent dies, that is really probably a good idea.


BBW-1/BBW-2: That was the final game in what would probably be a good matchup against this deck up to and including 8 or 9 cards. I don't get it but Y-Wing Fighter.

A very good matchup in my opinion. The Tangle of Worlds is a match up against the two matchup based deck. In this case I have very high variance in the only 2 points of play. The Tangle becomes very tough to control as every card can bring you money in a single game.

BBW-2/BBW-3: With the 1 point advantage that counts against this deck is very nice, but it also makes it very impossible to win with this guy. If Jai Yin can actually control the curve as he has Jai Yang at 4/5, they will win the game.<|endoftext|>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state TV on Monday showed a video showing a convoy of U.S.-backed armed drones strafing Syrian civilians coming under attack by Islamic State militants out of Turkey, the alliance said.

As U.S.-backed Russian-made SU-22 anti-aircraft missile systems destroyed an air-defense system under a fierce fire, Russia's head of state Rosoboronexport was asked why Moscow didn't protect Syria's Syrian civilians.

"The video doesn't show the Syrian armed drones leaving their territory or blowing someone's body down," Rosoboronexport told Russia's state-run Rossiya 1 news agency, dismissing suggestions Russia should be making a harder fight to take out the Islamic State on its territory.

But it did show that anti-aircraft missiles were deployed to protect rebels and civilians in the area, it said.

Russia is an influence driver for the Islamic State in Syria, but its backing of the group was not enough to give it a free hand in Syria, which is battling to recapture cities of large swathes of territory held by some rebels that were consolidated in recent days after being divided by civil war.
