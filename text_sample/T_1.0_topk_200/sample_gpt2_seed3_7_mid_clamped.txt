The woman's daughter moved from France, who had moved to Texas in 1895. "It was a horrible country," she said. "Everybody is so happy and so happy that everybody moves here, like so many other people in Texas."

Soon she moved to Long Beach, where an offer of room was made by her grandmother's boyfriend to move out to a much bigger, better-performing suburb. She said she even attended local food court once, where a lunch by the restaurant's owner was served directly at her.

Yet the neighborhood doesn't seem to be doing much well. Many of its residents think the neighborhood needs to learn Spanish, said the community's director of planning for development Grant Murphy, who has lived overnight at Long Beach-Theresienstadt's Renaissance Hotel for 18 years.

He said a manager at North South State Hospital, where patients often get admitted by air ambulance, felt the presence of the public instead of where the patients were and "was very happy to find that they would be able to find a doctor who can help them."

Murphy was shocked to learn that the same neighborhood has been plagued by what happened in the Miami-Dade police department in the days before the shooting, and he shared the news with the community as part of his own transformation into a true community.

Some of the first restaurants he visited were closed down. Others were opened, too.

The Long Beach neighborhood's top food critic, Eric Walker, believes that he understands where the problems are.

To look at the diversity found inside the restaurants, he said, "one should always ask just what the locals are doing. It's so important."

Barbara Van Rensburg, who runs Goodtown Miami.com just as her grandson and her father were preparing to make their way overseas, said she fears residents in Miami might pick up the culture of Miami.

After days of waiting in rush-hour traffic and dealing with commuters with mental health issues, she recalled an early 20th-century restaurant that had only a lunch menu of Mexican and French tapas, and offered only burritos.

"I saw a post-war restaurant called Taco Bell, and I thought to myself, it's just a taco bar for some weird-seeming Mexican game, and people might start to ask how they found Taco Bell," she said. "And I'd bet it was because, like. I come here because I like the place."
