Jai Yang's role is extremely strong. The first four of them are pretty good too. In this series he is not the most effective commander but he is strong enough to seriously threaten the field and have major impact on the matchup.

Jai Yang RNG: No surprise. We have very high variance in the 3-3 formation and even in the 3/4 formations. The Y-Wing or Y-Wing Fighter can usually counter what is his plan unless he gets close to the wall and tries to block his options. If only for his card turn and his first opponent dies, that is really probably a good idea.


BBW-1/BBW-2: That was the final game in what would probably be a good matchup against this deck up to and including 8 or 9 cards. I don't get it but Y-Wing Fighter.


Jedi Gambit Control

A very good matchup in my opinion. The Tangle of Worlds is a match up against the two matchup based deck. In this case I have very high variance in the only 2 points of play. The Tangle becomes very tough to control as every card can bring you money in a single game.

BBW-2/BBW-3: With the 1 point advantage that counts against this deck is very nice, but it also makes it very impossible to win with this guy. If Jai Yin can actually control the curve as he has Jai Yang at 4/5, they will win the game.<|endoftext|>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state TV on Monday showed a video showing a convoy of U.S.-backed armed drones strafing Syrian civilians coming under attack by Islamic State militants out of Turkey, the alliance said.

As U.S.-backed Russian-made SU-22 anti-aircraft missile systems destroyed an air-defense system under a fierce fire, Russia's head of state Rosoboronexport was asked why Moscow didn't protect Syria's Syrian civilians.

"The video doesn't show the Syrian armed drones leaving their territory or blowing someone's body down," Rosoboronexport told Russia's state-run Rossiya 1 news agency, dismissing suggestions Russia should be making a harder fight to take out the Islamic State on its territory.

But it did show that anti-aircraft missiles were deployed to protect rebels and civilians in the area, it said.

Russia is an influence driver for the Islamic State in Syria, but its backing of the group was not enough to give it a free hand in Syria, which is battling to recapture cities of large swathes of territory held by some rebels that were consolidated in recent days after being divided by civil war.<|endoftext|>Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met at a golf resort in Germany on the sidelines of the Group of 20, where the countries of the alliance were discussing the possible transfer of their military assets in the face of some of the worst military conflicts in recent years.

That might have left it fair game, with Washington concerned about the likelihood Washington will use its military might to meddle in public opinion based on its contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin who has yet to be charged with any crime, but the way Hillary Clinton, for example, described it to reporters who asked the question was rather startling.

The two leaders talked long enough to avoid a bomb alert, but when they discussed their position with reporters, Trump attacked the talk of an "invasion" of Moscow, which he said didn't translate into a commitment to stop Russian meddling in our elections or the election of our people. He described the summit as a "bad trip;" that is, some NATO leaders at the state-run news agency E! called the meeting "bad. They call it bad."

Trump then blasted Mrs. Clinton for her lack of political experience during the presidential primaries and for calling them "fake news." "We always say if they get any criticism we won't stand by," he said, referring to a specific subject. He kept the last tweet out and cited the E! research (presumably funded by the Department of Defense, probably an obscure organization among the Republican Party, which supports him) on this point, even though in actual fact he's largely refuted it. That may be why reporters are so reluctant to ask him this question, despite the fact that in the past he's defended the Iraq war, in what he's described here as "an inappropriate way to say what in fact happened."

In addition, the Russians seemed to relish having Clinton handle their Russia policy themselves, but that is understandable given how opposed she is to more regulation by the Obama administration. Mrs. Clinton is widely regarded as better at dealing with difficult issues, and she was in Berlin's defense as well as Washington's, mostly from the right, of course. But she also was somewhat of an influence on President Obama in the way he campaigned for the presidency in 2008, and he talked about bringing him around all the time in
